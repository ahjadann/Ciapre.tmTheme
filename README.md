It's based on [Andro](https://github.com/cyrilmengin/andro) color scheme but with more syntax highlighting sweetness.

##### *Tips* #####
--

* Use great with [Aqua](https://github.com/cafarm/aqua-theme) theme - Prokit. You won't be disappointed!
* Font used `Consolas` - comes with Windows, but alternatively, the open-sourced [Inconsolata](http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html) is pretty close to it
    * For more programming fonts, visit [http://slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts](http://slant.co/topics/67/~what-are-the-best-programming-fonts).

Well, you can do whatever you want. This is not big deal.

The only thing I ask is to share this on twitter/facebook/app.net or whatever social network .. or just tell your friends; so that more and more devs who using Sublime Text would know this color scheme. This is not rocket science code, but with more eye-pleasing color scheme for a text editor, I hope we could produce more efficient code! ;)

So, I am appreciated if you do! Thank you!
